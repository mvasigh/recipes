## What am I building?
A recipe-book application that...
- Doesn't have ads
- Works really well on iPad or mobile (responsive)
- Doesn't cost me anything?? (static)

## How will it work?

### Editing Experience (Netlify CMS?)
- Allow me to add new recipes
- Allow me to modify existing recipes
- Allow me to delete recipes

### Viewing Experience

#### Book View
- Show all of my recipes in a grid or list
- Allow me to sort and filter recipes by type of meal and/or ingredients

#### Recipe View
- Show me a single recipe with an ingredients list, an instructions list, and photos
- Allow me to convert ingredient amounts between units
- Allow me to adjust the number of servings of a recipe that I want to make
